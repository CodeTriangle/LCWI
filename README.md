# Language Cooker Web Interface
Siva Kalyan's [_Language Cooker_](https://github.com/conlang-software-dev/language-cooker) is an R program that generates your own
language. It was, however, difficult to use and access. This project was created in order to bring compatibility and ease of use
to a maximum.
